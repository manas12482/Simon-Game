# Overview
Simon is an electronic memory skill game that challenges players to replicate an ever-growing sequence of lights and sounds. It was invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison and introduced by Milton Bradley in 1978. The game is designed to test and enhance short-term memory and pattern recognition skills.

 # Game Rules and Gameplay
Game Start – The device randomly lights up one button and plays its corresponding sound.

Player Turn – The player must press the same button that was just illuminated.

Sequence Growth – If the player is correct, the game adds another step to the sequence.

Increasing Difficulty – The game continues adding steps to the sequence until the player makes a mistake.

# Game Over –
 If the player presses the wrong button, the game ends, and the final score is displayed (in some versions).

# Cognitive Benefits
Simon is more than just a fun game—it improves:

Memory – Strengthens working memory and pattern recognition.

Concentration – Requires focus to follow the sequences.

Reaction Time – Encourages quick and accurate responses.
